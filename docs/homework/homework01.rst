Homework 01
===========

**Due Date: Tuesday, Jan 24, by 11:00am CST**

My Name is Git Push
-------------------

Your task for the first homework is to create a new Git repository and populate
it with several files / folders. This Git repository must be pushed to GitHub,
and it will be used for the rest of the semester to turn in your homeworks.

Here are the requirements for the Git repository:

* Must contain a top level ``README.md`` with a simple description of what the
  repository is for
* Must contain a directory called ``homework01``
* The directory ``homework01`` must contain three Python scripts called ``script01.py``,
  ``script02.py``, and ``script03.py``, corresponding to the three numbered Exercise at the end of the
  `Python Refresher guide <https://coe-332-sp23.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit01/python_refresher.html#exercises>`_
* The directory ``homework01`` must also contain a ``README.md`` file with a
  descriptive title and short description of each of the three Python scripts
* **Must contain a minimum of two commits - use git log to see commits**
* Must be pushed to GitHub, and be either public or private (if private, make
  sure to add wallen@tacc.utexas.edu as an collaborator on the repo)

A sample Git repository may contain the following files after completing
homework 01:

.. code-block:: text

   my-coe332-hws/
   ├── homework01
   │   ├── README.md # specifically describes the contents of the homework01 directory
   │   ├── script01.py          
   │   ├── script02.py         
   │   └── script03.py
   └── README.md              # generally describes the whole repo

What to Turn In
---------------

Send an email to wallen@tacc.utexas.edu with the link to
your GitHub repository and include "Homework 01" in the subject line. We will
clone all of your repos at the due date / time for evaluation.
