Unit 4: Software Design and Introduction to APIs
================================================

In Unit 4, we will introduce the major Software Design concepts and principles that we will be learning throughout the 
semester and we will introduce Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs). This introduction will form the foundation of our ultimate goal to
create large, complex, Python-based applications that are accessible through
the web. The particular Python web framework we will be working with most is
called Flask.
